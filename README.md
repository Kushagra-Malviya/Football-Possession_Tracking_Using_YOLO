This project aims to revolutionize football analysis using advanced AI/ML techniques. By leveraging YOLO for object detection, OpenCV for vision processing, and Python for data integration, the system captures and evaluates key game moments in real-time. The objective is to offer a robust tool for deeper tactical insights, player tracking, and enhanced performance analysis, empowering teams to optimize strategies and make informed decisions. We have done this project for our Machine Learning course in 4th semester in SRMIST.
